# Pots and Pans 🍳

**Connecting Bronx businesses with Home Health Aides through verified donation campaigns and QR-code redemption.**

## Problem

Home Health Aides (HHAs) in the Bronx are undervalued and under-supported. Local businesses want to help but lack a streamlined way to donate goods directly to verified HHAs.

## Solution

Pots and Pans is a web platform where businesses create donation campaigns, an admin manages agency rosters, and HHAs claim and redeem donations via scannable QR codes — ensuring fair, verifiable distribution.

### How It Works

1. **Admin** adds home care agencies and uploads employee rosters
2. **Businesses** sign up and create donation campaigns (e.g., "10 Chicken Sandwiches")
3. The system **fairly distributes** donations to eligible HHAs — prioritizing those who haven't received one yet
4. **HHAs** claim their donation, receive a rotating QR code, and present it at the business
5. **Businesses** scan/validate the QR code to complete redemption
